# Windows commands

## Basic commands

With these commands you can access different directories and obtain information about the folders you are in. You can also create and delete folders and even files directly.

### cd
One of the most essential Windows console commands. It is used to change directories, using the formula *cd < DirectoryPath >* to go to the specific directory or folder that you tell it to, or *cd..* (with a colon) to exit a folder and go to the top level or folder where was staying.

### DIR
The command lists the contents of the directory or folder where you are, showing all the subfolders or files it contains. With this command you will be able to know if the file you are looking for is there or to which subfolder to navigate.

### TREE *FOLDER
It shows you the directory tree of a specific folder that you tell it

### CLS
Cleans the Windows console window, erasing everything that has been written in it, both your commands and the responses from the console itself. Everything will remain as if you had just opened it again.
