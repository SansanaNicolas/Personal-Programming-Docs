# General theory of Web Development.

## Internet
The ***internet*** or simply net is a global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the ***internet protocol suite*** (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It's a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies.

## Protocols
The internet procotol suite, commonly know as TCP/IP is a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks according to functional criteria. The foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Internet Protocol (IP). In the development of this networking mode, early versions of it were know as the Department of Defense (DoD) model because the research and development were funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.
The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking. An implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a protocol stack.

### IP
An ***Internet protocol address (IP address)*** is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main function: network interface identification and location addressing.

## World Wide Web
The ***World Wide Web (WWW)*** commonly known as the Web is an information system enabling documents and other web resources to be accessed over the Internet. Documents are downloadable media are made available to the network through web servers and can be accessed by programs such as web browsers. Servers and resources on the World Wide Web are identified and located through character strings called uniform resource locators (URLs). The original and still very common document type is a web page formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). This markup language supports plain text, images, embedded video and audio contents, and scripts (short programs) that implement complex user interaction.

## HTTP, HTTPS
***Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)*** is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

***Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)*** is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). it uses cryptography for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL.

## Web browsers
A ***web browser*** is a application software for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen. Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
A web browser is not the same thing as a ***search engine***, though the two are ofter confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.

## Domain vs URL
A ***domain name*** is a text string that maps to a numeric IP address, which is used to access a website from client software. Put more simply, a domain name is the text that a user types into a browser window to reach a particular website.

A ***Uniform Resource Locator (URL)***, sometimes called a web address, contains the domain name of a site, as well as other information, such as the transfer protocol and path. For example, int he URL "https://instagram.com/profile", "instagram.com" is the domain name, "https" is the protocol, and "/profile" is the path to a specific website page.

## Hosting
Hosting, in its most generic sense, is a service through which storage and computing resources are providing to an individual or organization for the accomodation and maintenance of one or more websites and related services. While hosting doesn't need to be IP-based, the vast majority of instances are web-based services that allow a website or web service to be globally accessible from the internet. Hosting is also known as Web hosting or website hosting.

## DNS
The ***Domain Name System (DNS)*** is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for computers, services, and other resources in ther internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the associated entities. Most prominently, it translates readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. The Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the internet since 1985.

## Client-server model
The ***client-server model*** is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or device, called ***servers***, and service requesters, called ***clients***. Often clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A client usually does not share any of its resources, but it requests content or service from a server. Clients, therefore, intiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client-server model are email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.

## Web services
A web service (WS) is either:
- a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the Internet, or
- a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images).

The use of the term "web" in Web service is a misnomer. Web services do not use the WWW, a human user interface running on the internet, but rather a machine-to-machine service running on the internet using the WWW protocols.
In a web service, a web technology such as HTTP is used for transferring machine-readable file formats such as XML and JSON.

## Data bases
In computing, a ***database*** is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault torelance.

A ***database management system (DBMS)*** is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS software additionally encompasses the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term "database" is also used loosely to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database. 

## IDEs

An integrated development environment or interactive development environment is a computer application that provides comprehensive services to facilitate software development for the developer or programmer. Typically, an IDE consists of a source code editor, automatic build tools, and a debugger. Most IDEs have intelligent code completion (IntelliSense). Some IDEs contain a compiler, an interpreter, or both, such as NetBeans and Eclipse; others don't, like SharpDevelop and Lazarus.

## Source-code editor 

Is a text editor program designed specifically for editing source code of computer programs, it may be a standalone application or it may be built into an integrated development environment (IDE) or web browser. Source-code editors are a fundamental programming tool, as the fundamental job of programmers is to write and edit source code. These editors have characteristics specifically designed to simplify and speed up typing of source code, such as syntax highlighting, indentation, autocomplete and brace matching funcionality, also provide a convenient way to fun a compiler.

## WEB Development

Web development is the work involved in developing a websie for the Internet (WWW) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web desing, Web content development, cliente-side/ server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of developers and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: ***Front-end developer***, ***back-end developer*** and ***full-stack developer***. Front-end devs are responsible for behavior and visuals, that run in the user browser, while back-end devs deal with the servers, data bases and APIs.

## Programming language

A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs. Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer languange. The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language.

## Programming paradigms

Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms. Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar.

## Imperative programming

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm of software that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform.

## Declarative programming 

Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. Many languages that apply this style attemp to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing what the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe how to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives. This is in contrast with imperative programming, which implements algorithms in explicit steps. Declarative programming ofter considers programs as theories of a formal logic, and computations as deductions in that logic space. Declarative programming may greatly simplify writing parallel programs.

## Object-oriented programming (OOP)
 
 Is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and the code is in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A common feature of objects it that procedures (or methods) are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. In this brand of OOP, there is usually a special name such as this or self used to refer to the current object. In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. OOP languages are diverse, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types. Many of the most widely used programming languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming.
